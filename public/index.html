                Two consecutive earthquakes in southern Turkey and northwest Syria caused immense devastation, <strong>resulting in over 22,000 casualties and ranking among the century's worst natural disasters.</strong>The initial 7.8-magnitude quake struck just after 4 a.m. near Gaziantep, a city of more than 2 million people, followed by a 7.5-magnitude aftershock nine hours later, accompanied by over 150 subsequent tremors.</span>

        <div class="text6">The trembling earth beneath Turkey's feet has long been a testament to the capricious nature of our planet. In recent times, the heart-wrenching reverberations 
            of devastating earthquakes have once again shaken the nation, reminding us of the profound danger that lurks beneath the surface. Yet, as we strive to comprehend
             the magnitude of this threat,
             we find ourselves entangled in a tapestry woven with the threads of geologic history, human memory, and the eerie anticipation of a future disaster.</div>



             <div class="text7"> <strong>Forgotten Lessons - Humanity's Tendency to Erase the Past</strong>
                Time's relentless march often sweeps away the remnants of history, leaving us vulnerable to repeating its mistakes. The echoes of past tragedies become
                 fainter with each generation, their significance eclipsed by the distractions of the present. Yet, the question remains: Have we allowed ourselves to become prisoners of
                 our own history's cyclical pattern? Can we break free from the chains of complacency and forge a new understanding that acknowledges the lessons of yesteryears?</div>

        <div class="text9"> GeoTurk is dedicated to raising awareness about the relentless and dramatic seismic activity that has long haunted Turkey's history.
             Our mission emphasizes the critical need to remember and learn from the past tragedies that have shattered our land. Turkey's unique geography renders it profoundly vulnerable
              to these seismic forces, leaving behind a dramatic tale of destruction. With knowledge, we believe we can transform this narrative from one of destruction to resilience. 
            We are unwavering in our commitment to fostering community engagement and collaboration, driven by the urgent quest to create a safer and more resilient future.</div>
